As an individual learner it is crucial to set up a Trial Account to explore and learn about the platform free tier services that are offered by AWS for a period of 1 year 
There are 3 categories of the free tier services:

1) 12 Month free :Enjoy these offers for 12-months following your initial sign-up date to AWS
2) Always free : These free tier offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers
3) Short term free : They start from the date you activate a particular service 

Startups may be eligible for AWS credits.  AWS Activate provides eligible startups with a host of resources, including free AWS credits to spend on AWS services, and AWS Support

Once the root account has been activated there are certain best practices you should follow:

1) Setting up the multi factor authentication for the root account
2) The root account should not be used for general use and rather IAM users should be created.
3) You can change the alias for the root account.



AWS CLI InstallInstructions:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the MSI installation by downloading the installer from : https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

Run the installation on your machine ( Windows or any other platform)

After the installation you can verify the installation by running the following command:
C:\Users\jsingh46>aws --version
aws-cli/2.11.12 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off

To configure the access key and secret key from local machine you can go to AWS console and open IAM user account --> security credentials --> Access Key
Add access key ID and secret key ( copy the access key and secret key locally) , although not a very safe process here as you are copying the password info locally and can be compromised but can be used for sake of simplicity to explore the AWS CLI.
There are several options avilable to configure the access better though IAM identity center and other related options but for now lets use this.

Run the following command: 

aws configure --> Enter access key ID and secret key --> default region and output format (option al)

Check the configuration by running the following command:

aws s3 ls -- if the bucket exists in your account 

aws s3 mb s3://testbuckket456  -- if the bucket does not exist in your account 



AWS CLOUD SHELL ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is safe way to access and run commands , it is a managed environment inside console .

The authentication set up is not required as the console credentials are used to access the services from shell and it comes preinstalled with many utilities.

1 GB storage provided as well.
