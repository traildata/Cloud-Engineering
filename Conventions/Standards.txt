Developer Guidelines:

1) There are dedicated branches for different cloud platforms and they will act as staging areas before the code is promoted to master branch.

2) The developers can create individual branches with following name conventions:

feature/{nameofcloud}-developerid-{versionnumber}
e.g : feature/GCP-jack67-v1.0

3) The developer branches should be created from the individual staging branches of cloud platforms which are below:

feature/AWS 
feature/GCP
feature/SNOWFLAKE
feature/AZURE

4) The pull requests should always be created against the staging branch of cloud platforms.
